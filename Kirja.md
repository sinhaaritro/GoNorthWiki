Kirja is the wiki component of GoNorth.  
On the top right you will find a button to enter edit mode and on the right of this button you can find an arrow to expand or collapse the wiki sidebar.  
Please note: While a user edits a page this page will be readonly for other users to prevent them from overwriting each others changes.

## Editor
If the user enters edit mode the button at the top right will be hidden and the following buttons are visible:
 * **Save**: Saves the current page
 * **Delete**: Deletes the current page. Please note: A page can only be deleted if its not marked in a map and no other page is referencing the current page.
 * **Stop editing**: Will leave the edit mode

While editing a page you can rename it using the textbox at the top. You will also find a toolbar at the top for rich text editing. Apart from normal rich text formating you can also find the following icons:
 * **Book**: By clicking on this icon you can eiter choose an existing page and insert a link to this page, or click on "Create new page" to create a new page. If you click "Create new page" a new window will open where you can define the name of the page and enter the text. Upon saving the new page a link to this page will be inserted in the original wiki page.
 * **Chess King**: If you have the Aika role you can click this button to choose a quest and insert a link for this quest in the page.
 * **Person**: If you have the Kortisto role you can click this button to choose a npc and insert a link for this npc in the page.
 * **Apple**: If you have the Styr role you can click this button to choose an item and insert a link for this item in the page.
 * **Flash**: If you have the Evne role you can click this button to choose an skill and insert a link for this skill in the page.

After insert a link and saving a page the current page will be shown in the form for the different objects as a related Kirja page. If you remove the link to the object again it will also remove this reference.

 * A link to open the page list
