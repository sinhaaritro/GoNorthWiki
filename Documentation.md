## Code Api Documentation Generation
GoNorth uses [DocFX](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/) for generating the server side code api documentation and [JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/) for client side code api documentation. If you want to generate the code api documentation you will have to install both of these to be available from the command line.  
Afterwards you can run "/Documentation/ApiDocumentation/generateDocumentation.bat" (or if you are in a non windows environment take a look at this file and run the commands, its really not much). These commands will generate the documentation and you can find it under "/Documentation/ApiDocumentation/GoNorthServerSide/generatedDocumentation/index.html" and "/Documentation/ApiDocumentation/GoNorthClientSide/generatedDocumentation/index.html".

## UML Diagram
You can find a rough UML diagram I used for my planning in "/Documentation/GoNorth.simp". You can open it using the [Software Ideas Modeler](https://www.softwareideas.net/). Like I said its really a very rough diagram which I created only for myself while coming up with a plan on how to implement the different modules. But maybe it can still help you.

## Wireframes
I created some wireframes while planning the modules. You can find them in "/Documentation/Wireframes". I changed the programs I used during the implementation multiple times since it was hard to find a program that I really liked and could used so you will have to open some using [Wireframe Sketcher](http://wireframesketcher.com/), some using PowerPoint and some using [Pencil](https://pencil.evolus.vn/). But I'm not really sure if these wireframes will help you a lot since all the forms I sketched there are already implemented.
