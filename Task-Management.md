By clicking the tasks home icon or selecting tasks in the navigation bar at the top you can open the task management page.
At the right you will find a drop down list that allows you to switch the current board. If you have the Manage Task Boards role you can select "Manage task boards" to open the manage task boards page.

## Task Board
If you have a task board selected you can click on "Create task group" to create a new task group. In the dialog you can add a title, description, assignee and status. The toolbar above the description has the same icons as the [Kirja wiki page](/steffendx/GoNorth/wiki/Kirja) toolbar.  
Please note: While a user edits a task group or task this task group or task will be readonly for other users to prevent them from overwriting each others changes.  
After pressing the save button you will see the task group in the board.  
By clicking the arrow left to the task group you can collapse or expand the task group. You can click on the name of the task group to edit the task group. The same dialog as for creating a task group will open in this case. The only difference is a delete button at the button.  
On the task group card you can also assign the task to someone or adjust the status of the task group.  
Please note: A closed task group will be collapsed by default upon loading the board.  
On the right of the task group you can find a "+" button which allows you to add a new task to the task group. The same dialog as for task groups will open in this case. After adding a task it will be shown as a card in the task group. You can now click on the name to edit the task and view details. By using the dropdown list you can quickly assign a task to someone. You can also drag and drop a task between the different columns.

## Task Board Management
On the task board management page you can click the "Create task board" button. In the dialog you have to provide a task board name. You can also specify a planned start date and planned end date which will be displayed next to the board name.  
Below you will find a list of open and closed task boards. You can click on a task board name to open the board. In the most right column you will find the following buttons:
 * **Pencil**: Allows you to edit the board name and dates.
 * **Trash bin**: Allows you to delete the board. Please note: Only an empty board can be deleted.
 * **Checkmark or Circle arrow**: Allows you to close the board or reopen the board. A closed board will not appear in the list of boards in the board selection.
