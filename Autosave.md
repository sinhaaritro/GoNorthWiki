To prevent data loss GoNorth has integrated support for autosaving the different forms in the system. This feature will automatically save your changes every minute if unsaved changes exist.  
If you want to disable the autosave feature you will have to change the **DisableAutoSaving** appsettings key in the misc section to true.
